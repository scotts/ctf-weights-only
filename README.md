This repo allows you to sum any 3 numbers using PyTorch in the cloud.
Just create a PR with updated weights.pt file by modifying

as a comment on your PR. You can use any 3 numbers!

Notice that we only use weights.pt file from your PR and delete the rest,
so it's totally safe for us and you can not get our secrets!
